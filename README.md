# Starlogue-Weaving Lifeâ€™s Moments Among the Stars.

## Project Overview
**Objective:** Develop an interactive 3D web application to visualize life moments, habits, and emotions as constellations in a personal galaxy, complemented by an AI-powered digital scrapbook for capturing and sharing memories.

**Problem Statement:** 
Modern tools for memory-keeping are fragmented, static, and lack intelligent insights, making it difficult for users to explore their life journey dynamically. 

**Solution:** A unified platform that visualizes life events as interactive constellations, offers intelligent memory rediscovery, and integrates social sharing with personalization.

## Key Features
1. **Galactic Memory Mapping:** 
   - Life events represented as stars in a personalized galaxy.
   - Connections via constellations showcasing relationships, habits, and emotions.

2. **Time Capsules:** 
   - Personalized messages as comets orbiting until a set date.

3. **Dynamic Evolution:** 
   - Galaxy grows with user input, reflecting personal growth.

4. **AI Navigation Guide:** 
   - Explore overlooked memories, identify patterns, and provide insights.

5. **Digital Scrapbook:**
   - Curated visuals, mood-based music, and interactive templates.
   - Export scrapbook pages for social sharing.

6. **Customization:** 
   - Editable themes (e.g., gothic, neon, anime) and personalization features.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Three.js.
- **Backend:** FastAPI/Django, OAuth, PostgreSQL, Neo4j.
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch/TensorFlow for NLP and mood analysis.
- **Cloud Deployment:** AWS, Firebase, or Vercel.
